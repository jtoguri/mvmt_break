    <p>
      Many people work sitting in front of a computer for long
      periods of time. This leads to sedentary behavior characterized by
      low energy expenditure while in the sitting or reclined position.
      This lifestyle is commonly reffered to as the "sitting disease"
      because it is associate with an increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis, among other
      negative health impacts.
