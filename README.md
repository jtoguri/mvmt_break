# Mvmt Break

A full stack web application allowing users to quickly generate exercises and save completed exercises to their history for tracking.

While learning to code I realized I was sitting down for extended
periods of time. Mvmt_Break helps to break up these sitting periods with a mix of exercises.

The project includes a MongoDB database, an API built with Node.js and Express, and a client-side application built with ReactJS.

See the [planning](planning) directory for more background information.
